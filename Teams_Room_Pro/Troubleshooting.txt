| **License assigned**                 | The room account must have a **Teams Rooms Pro license** (not Basic or Shared Device).           | In M365 Admin → Users → Active Users → search room → Licenses tab.                                                        |
| **Device signed in as room account** | If it’s logged in with a user or cached credentials, the management agent won’t attach properly. | On the Crestron device → Settings → About → check “Signed in as”.                                                         |
| **Teams Rooms app version**          | Must be ≥ **4.19 (Windows)** or latest **Teams Rooms on Android** build.                         | Settings → About or via the Crestron XiO Cloud.                                                                           |
| **Internet access**                  | The device must reach Microsoft endpoints.                                                       | Confirm outbound HTTPS to `*.rooms.microsoft.com` and `*.teams.microsoft.com` isn’t being blocked by your proxy/firewall. |

Crestron Flex — Platform Differences

| Device Type                          | Platform                  | Notes for Management                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crestron Flex UC-C / UC-M series** | Windows-based Teams Rooms | Must install the **Teams Rooms Pro Management Agent** (MSI) manually or via Intune if not bundled.  |
| **Crestron Flex UC-B / UC-P series** | Android-based Teams Rooms | Onboarding is automatic once Teams app is signed in, provided the correct license and connectivity. |

For Windows-based Crestron Devices

Check the Agent Service
On the device, open Services.msc.
Look for Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management Agent.
Status should be Running
Startup type: Automatic
If missing → install it manually:
	msiexec /i TeamsRoomsManagementAgent.msi /qn

Confirm Device Registration

Run as admin:
	Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\TeamsRooms -Class DeviceStatus

You should see:
	Connected : True
	DeviceId  : <GUID>
	
If Connected = False, run:
	Restart-Service TeamsRoomsManagementAgent

Check TLS Inspection / Proxy
If your org uses SSL inspection, ensure you exclude:
	*.rooms.microsoft.com
	rooms.microsoft.com
	roomspro.microsoft.com
	*.azureedge.net
	*.servicebus.windows.net

Reboot and wait 10–15 min.
It can take a few polling cycles before the device appears in the portal.

Account token / sign-in drift

Room account signed in vs cached/bad token; or signed in with the wrong UPN.
Quick check on device: Settings → About → “Signed in as”.

Time skew / NTP

Even ±5 minutes can break cloud token validation.
Quick check: w32tm /query /status and ensure NTP is reachable.

Proxy / SSL inspection asymmetry
Same VLAN ≠ same egress policy. One host may be hitting a different PAC/WPAD or bypass list.
Quick check: 
	netsh winhttp show proxy 
	and the user proxy under HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings.

Host firewall / EDR policy variance

Defender Firewall or EDR (ASR rules) silently blocking SChannel, WinHTTP, or background telemetry for one host.Certificate chain differences

Broken or intercepted chain to Microsoft endpoints on the failing host only.

Device identity drift
Entra ID (AAD) join state or device record problem; stale/duplicate device object; MDM channel conflicts.

Microsoft Presidio is a tool that helps automatically detect and remove sensitive information like names or ID numbers from documents and messages. When set up using Docker (a way to run software in isolated containers), it works well—but only if kept up to date and secured properly. Recently, experts found a flaw that could let some sensitive data slip through undetected, and older versions may also include outdated parts that could be risky. To stay safe, we need to use the latest version, restrict who can access it, and follow best practices when installing it—just like we would for any other software that handles private data.

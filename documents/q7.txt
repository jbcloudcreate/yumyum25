Q6 — Will you be self-employed or employed?

Tick: Self Employed

Details (if there’s a box or comments field):
“I will be operating as a self-employed delivery partner/courier using the Uber Eats platform. This is ad-hoc, casual work outside my contracted working hours.”

(If they force you to provide “employer details” even when self-employed, use this line:)
“Platform: Uber Eats (delivery partner). I am not employed by Uber; I will be self-employed.”

Q7 — What type of work does the Business Interest entail?

Specific details of what you will be doing:
“Food delivery/courier work using the Uber Eats app. I will accept delivery requests on an ad-hoc basis, collect orders from local restaurants/takeaways and deliver them to customers. No specialist equipment is required beyond my mobile phone and vehicle. This work will be carried out entirely outside my normal working hours and will not impact my primary role.”

How many hours per month do you expect to work?
Option A (safe/typical): “Approximately 20–40 hours per month (varies week to week).”
Option B (if you want to match 8–10 hours/week): “Approximately 35–45 hours per month (varies).”
Option C (if you want to stay conservative): “Approximately up to 25 hours per month.”

Where will you be conducting the business interest?
“In the local area (e.g., my local town/city and surrounding areas). Work will be conducted while travelling between restaurants and customer addresses. No work will be carried out at my primary workplace, and no employer systems, equipment, or time will be used.”

Optional extra line (only if there’s a “conflict / assurance” box)

“I will ensure appropriate vehicle insurance is in place for delivery/courier use and I will immediately declare any potential conflict of interest should one arise.”

If you tell me roughly how many hours you actually plan to do (e.g., “2 evenings a week + a few hours Saturday”), I’ll tighten the hours/month line so it’s accurate and consistent with the rest of the form.

can you condense Q7 please due to the space on the form

Absolutely — here are condensed, copy-paste options for Q7 (pick the shortest that fits).

Q7 (Option A – balanced / very short)

“Ad-hoc Uber Eats delivery partner: collect food orders from local restaurants and deliver to customers using the app, outside my contracted hours. Approx. 20–40 hrs/month. Local area (restaurants to customer addresses). No employer time/equipment used.”

Q7 (Option B – ultra short)

“Uber Eats food delivery (self-employed), ad-hoc outside my normal working hours. Est. 20–40 hrs/month. Local area (collection + delivery). No employer resources used.”

Q7 (Option C – if you want to state 8–10 hrs/week)

“Uber Eats delivery (self-employed), evenings/weekends only. Est. 35–45 hrs/month (approx. 8–10 hrs/week). Local area. No employer time/equipment used.”

If you tell me roughly how many hours you’re putting down, I’ll lock it to one clean final sentence that fits your exact space.
